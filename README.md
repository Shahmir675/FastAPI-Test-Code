# FastAPI Test Code

Welcome to the FastAPI Test Code repository! This repository serves as a testing ground for API development, specifically focusing on the deployment of machine learning and deep learning models. While my primary goal is to practice and experiment with FastAPI, I also aim to enhance my overall understanding of API development, ensuring that my learning is tailored to my needs.

**Note**: The code in this repository may be incomplete and might not adhere to many clean code principles, as the primary goal is learning, with only a cursory focus on clean code unless absolutely necessary.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find practice and test code that demonstrates various aspects of building APIs using FastAPI. Please note that this is not a production-ready application; rather, it serves as a space for learning and experimentation.

### Objectives

- Experiment with FastAPI for creating robust APIs.
- Deploy machine learning models through API endpoints.
- Gain a deeper understanding of API development concepts.
